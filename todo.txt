- when mem::Alloc is implemented, check if NeedRAM needs to save/restore registers
- mem::Free can't remove handles archived by the swap handler
- implement --flags command
- write swap handler
- written / reallocated handles must be swapped out before reallocation
- add source files to swapable files
- test asmhd::RemoveLastEntry
- release memory on exit
