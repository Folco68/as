- when mem::Alloc is implemented, check if NeedRAM needs to save/restore registers
- implement --flags command
- write swap handler
- written / reallocated handles must be swapped out before reallocation
- add source files to swapable files
- test asmhd::RemoveLastEntry
- release memory on exit
- test SWAP_OUT macro (mem.asm)
- test Hd2FullName (mem.asm)
- check that included files are added to the swapable files through AddToSwapableFileHd
- SWAP_OUT macro is too big? Should turn some part or the whole macro into a function ?
- write consistency checks at the end of a file parsing (macro refcount, etc)
- use asmhd::AddEntryToAssemblyHandle in mem::AddToSwapableFileHd to avoid manual reallocation
- NeedRAM() could return true if some data have been swapped in, it would allow fine-tuned swaping
- Symbol: missing info: the offset in the binary must be recorded!
